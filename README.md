Tracking Creepy Internet of Things

The Problem :

Iot products and services can be 'creepy' in many ways.

IoT products can invade privacy and watch, listen or track us in under-the-hood ways.

Many IoT products are designed to be 'always-on' black boxes - we cannot control the functioning of the devices easily and we cannot look under the hood. 

The current economic models of data collection and surveillance tech create increasing incentives for IoT manufacturers to collect data in sneaky or non transparent ways.

The Solution :

Calling all watchdogs, whistleblowers, activists and citizens!

Share examples of creepy IoT encounters.

Expose invasive IoT products.

Advocate for a safe and trustworthy data future.
